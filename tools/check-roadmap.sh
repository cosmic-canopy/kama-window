# check-roadmap.sh — ROADMAP.md stays the short ordered list; each row's reasoning stays where it links.
#
# Ported from kama's tools/check-roadmap.sh, as friendly-fire-department's is, with FFD's per-row ceiling. ROADMAP.md
# answers "what do we do next", and only while that answer is readable in one screen: kama's and FFD's each passed a
# thousand lines once by absorbing their reasoning, and FFD's grew sideways along single rows once a line ceiling held
# its length. So the invariants are structural:
#   1. ROADMAP.md is under a line ceiling, and every row under a character ceiling.
#   2. Every `ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#anchor` link in ROADMAP.md resolves to an anchor that exists.
#   3. Every anchor in ROADMAP_DETAIL.md is reached by some row: detail nothing schedules is a changelog.
#   4. Every row id is `WIN-<n>`, and unique. An id is permanent: never reused, never renumbered.
#   5. Every `WIN-<n>` cited in either file names a row that exists.
#   6. The `Next id:` counter is above every id ROADMAP.md has ever issued, its own history included.
